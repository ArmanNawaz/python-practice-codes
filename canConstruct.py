# 605 Â· Sequence Reconstruction LintCode
# Description
# Check whether the original sequence org can be uniquely 
# reconstructed from the sequences in seqs. The org sequence 
# is a permutation of the integers from 1 to n, with 1 <= n <= 10^4. 

# Reconstruction means building a shortest common supersequence
#  of the sequences in seqs (i.e., a shortest sequence so that 
#  all sequences in seqs are subsequences of it). Determine whether 
#  there is only one sequence that can be reconstructed from seqs 
#  and it is the org sequence.


# Example 1:

# Input:org = [1,2,3], seqs = [[1,2],[1,3]]
# Output: false
# Explanation:
# [1,2,3] is not the only one sequence that can be reconstructed,
#  because [1,3,2] is also a valid sequence that can be 
#  reconstructed.

# Example 2:

# Input: org = [1,2,3], seqs = [[1,2]]
# Output: false
# Explanation:
# The reconstructed sequence can only be [1,2], can't 
# reconstruct the sequence [1,2,3]. 

# Example 3:

# Input: org = [1,2,3], seqs = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
# Output: true
# Explanation:
# The sequences [1,2], [1,3], and [2,3] can uniquely reconstruct 
# the original sequence [1,2,3].

# Example 4:

# Input:org = [4,1,5,2,6,3], seqs = [[5,2,6,3],[4,1,5,2]]
# Output:true
